 * ultimate ownership of the changed attribute is difficult to discern. That is,
 * it might be a LineStyle--but whose line style?
 * 
 * The other thing a help can do is provide a rendere and/or an edior for non
 * standard objects. If an AttributeTable has to deal with an unknown Object
 * type, it will ask all its helpers for a renderer or an editor, and use the
 * first one it gets.
