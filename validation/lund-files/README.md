Pi0 decay to two photons. Created using Stepan's spgen event generator.

## gen.pid_\*.dat

Created with clas12-offline-software/validation/unit-tests/src/events/RandomEventGenerator.java.
Each event contains a forward electron and one other final state particle.
All the particles are distributed randomly with some semi-reasonable spread.
