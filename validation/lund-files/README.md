Created with clas12-offline-software/validation/unit-tests/src/events/RandomEventGenerator.java.
Each event contains a forward electron and one of the four final states:
1. proton gamma
1. mu+ gamma
1. mu- pi+
1. pi+ pi- n
These final states are repeatedly cycled through in this order.
All the particles are distributed randomly with some semi-reasonable spread.
