/**
 * A package containing classes for the implementation of a hit in the DC.
 * The package contains the base - hit class Hit which gets instantiated upon reading the simulated bank.
 * The FittedHit class extends the hit class and has fields representing the results of fits to the clusters including the hits.
 * The MCHit class is used for truth-association with simulated data.  It contains truth information to be matched to reconstructed values,
 * such as DOCA, Left-Right Ambiguity value, etc...
